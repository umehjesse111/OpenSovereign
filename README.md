# OpenSoverign DAO

OpenSoverign is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. The platform enables decentralized governance and community-driven decision-making through a secure and transparent voting system.

## Features

- **Token-Based Governance**: Voting power is proportional to token holdings
- **Proposal System**: Create and manage community proposals
- **Secure Voting**: Protected against double voting and timing attacks
- **Transparent Execution**: Automated proposal execution based on voting outcomes

## Smart Contract Architecture

The DAO is built using the following core components:

### Token Management
- Fixed total supply management
- Balance tracking per address
- Secure transfer functionality

### Proposal System
- Proposal creation with title and description
- Automatic proposal lifecycle management
- Voting period enforcement
- Proposal status tracking

### Voting Mechanism
- Token-weighted voting system
- Vote delegation capabilities
- Time-bound voting periods
- Protection against double voting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Stacks CLI](https://docs.stacks.co/references/stacks-cli)
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet)
- Node.js and npm (for development environment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opensoverign
cd opensoverign
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run local development environment
```bash
clarinet integrate
```

## Contract Deployment

1. Configure your network settings in `Clarinet.toml`

2. Deploy the contract
```bash
clarinet deploy --network testnet
```

## Usage

### Creating a Proposal

```clarity
(contract-call? .opensoverign create-proposal 
    "Proposal Title" 
    "Proposal Description")
```

### Casting a Vote

```clarity
(contract-call? .opensoverign vote 
    proposal-id 
    true)  ;; true for yes, false for no
```

### Checking Proposal Status

```clarity
(contract-call? .opensoverign get-proposal 
    proposal-id)
```

## Security Considerations

- Token transfers are protected against overflow
- Voting mechanisms include timelock periods
- Proposal execution requires successful vote completion
- Contract owner privileges are limited to essential functions
